Step 1 -
Stir  the sugar, cream, and milk into a pan over low heat until sugar has completely dissolved. Heat it just until mix is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge of the pan.
Step 2 - 
Transfer cream mixture into a container. Stir in vanilla extract and chill the mix for at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best, and recommended.)
Step 3 - 
Pour the cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and mix it, for around 20 - 25 minutes. 
Step 4 - 
When ice cream is softly frozen, serve it immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place it in the freezer. 
Step 5 - 
Eat the ice cream and enjoy!
